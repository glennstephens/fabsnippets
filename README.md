# fabsnippets

First, make sure you check out https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous. In it's own words its a 

This library allows you to use the ultra-simple Model-View-Update architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more. It is a variation of elmish, an Elm architecture implemented in F#. Elmish was originally written for Fable applications, however it is used here for applications using Xamarin.Forms.

So once you've installed it and got something running, you could add these snippets to your IDE. Myself, I'm using Visual Studio for the Mac and I'm placing the snippet files in ~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Snippets folder. 

Once installed, the snippets will start with *fab* and you'll be able to add some UI elements reasonably quickly. 

The snippets I've added are:

* fabLabel: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.Label
* fabLabelCentered: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.Label with centered text
* fabLabelRight: You guessed it, Xamarin.Forms.Lbel with right justification
* fabButton: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.Button
* fabActivityIndicator: Creates an Xamarin.Forms.ActivityIndicator
* fabBoxView: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.BoxView
* fabEntry: Creates an Xamarin.Forms.Entry
* fabSlider: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.Slider
* fabStackLayout: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout
* fabStackLayoutHorizontal: Creates a Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout with a Horizontal orientation

These are the first snippets at the moment. I'll add and update over time

Enjoy. If you have questions, you can DM on twitter via @glenntstephens
