# fabsnippets

First, make sure you check out https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous. In it's own words its a 

This library allows you to use the ultra-simple Model-View-Update architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more. It is a variation of elmish, an Elm architecture implemented in F#. Elmish was originally written for Fable applications, however it is used here for applications using Xamarin.Forms.

So once you've installed it and got something running, you could add these snippets to your IDE. Myself, I'm using Visual Studio for the Mac and I'm placing the snippet files in ~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Snippets folder. 

Once installed, the snippets will start with *fab* and you'll be able to add some UI elements reasonably quickly. 

The snippets I've added are:

* fabLabel: Creates a label
* fabLabelCentered: Creates a label with centered text
* fabLabelRight: You guessed it, label with right justification
* fabButton: Creates a button
* etc...

Once you type *fab* you should see the available options that are there. 

Enjoy. If you have questions, you can DM on twitter via @glenntstephens
